\section{Objetives met}
Given the initial project objectives: Tool Research, Case Study, Documentation

\section{Limitations}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Limited options for iOS open source apps.
		\item Time scope of the project was not enough to actually develop the case study with different types of automation tools.
		\item All in one tools can be very expensive. For example, TestComplete will easily cost more than 6,000 USD a year with no add-ons.
	\end{itemize}


\section{Future work}

This project has several opportunities for improvement:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Performing the same case study content with more test automation tools. 
		\item Making use of more iOS applications in order to reference more real world test cases and automated test scripts.
		\item Expanding the coverage tables, including more GUI components, gestures and testing capabilities for the used tools.
	\end{itemize}
