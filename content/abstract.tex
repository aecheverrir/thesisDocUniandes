In todayâ€™s mobile market, applications have increased in complexity unimaginably, they now represent the only channel to a service, or they intend to offer the same features web and desktop systems currently provide. This means, mobile development teams have to step up their quality assurance process through the introduction of test automation into their projects in order to maintain these highly complex and user demanding apps. This paper pretends to compare a set of existing tools for user interface mobile test automation over the iOS environment, with the purpose of easing the decision of selecting the appropriate automation tool based on your specific needs. In the other hand, during the development of this project, a case study will be designed whereby the selected automation tools will be used with the intent of recognizing and documenting their strengths and weaknesses.
